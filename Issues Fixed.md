# Object Detection and Tracking Fixes

## Issues Fixed

After analyzing the code and logs, several issues were identified and fixed to improve object detection:

1. **Confidence Threshold Issue**:
   - The code was using a hardcoded confidence threshold of 0.1 instead of the configured value
   - Fixed to properly use the user-defined or default confidence threshold (0.25)

2. **Image Preprocessing Problems**:
   - Improved image preprocessing to maintain aspect ratio
   - Added proper handling for different YOLOv5 model versions
   - Fixed BGR to RGB conversion and tensor formatting

3. **IoU Threshold Configuration**:
   - Added explicit setting of IoU threshold for newer YOLOv5 models
   - Previous code was missing proper threshold configuration

4. **Debug Information**:
   - Added additional logging to show detectable classes
   - Improved diagnostic information for troubleshooting

## Testing the Fix

To test the fixed detection code:

1. Run with the updated script:
   ```
   python main.py --source car-detection.mp4 --display --save-video --output-dir results
   ```

2. If issues persist, try adjusting the confidence threshold:
   ```
   python main.py --source car-detection.mp4 --display --save-video --confidence 0.2
   ```

3. For detailed debugging, enable verbose logging in the configuration file.

## Technical Details

### Problem Root Cause

1. The main issue was that the confidence threshold was being overridden with a hardcoded value (0.1) in the code, but then not being used correctly with the YOLOv5 model.

2. The image preprocessing didn't maintain aspect ratio, which can cause distortion and missed detections.

3. Newer YOLOv5 models require proper IoU threshold setting for non-maximum suppression.

### Changes Made

1. Fixed confidence threshold handling to use the configured value
2. Improved image preprocessing to maintain aspect ratio based on the model's stride
3. Added IoU threshold configuration for newer YOLOv5 models
4. Enhanced preprocessing to better handle different model versions
5. Added more diagnostic logging

These changes should significantly improve detection performance while maintaining compatibility with different YOLOv5 model versions.
